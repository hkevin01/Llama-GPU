# Security Audit & Analytics Integration Plan

This document outlines the initial steps for improving security and integrating analytics in the Llama-GPU project.

## Security Audit Steps
1. **Dependency Review**
   - Audit `requirements.txt` and `package.json` for vulnerabilities.
   - Use `pip-audit` and `npm audit` in CI/CD.
2. **Code Review**
   - Static analysis with `bandit` (Python) and `eslint` (Node.js).
   - Enforce pre-commit hooks for security checks.
3. **Secrets Management**
   - Ensure `.env` and secret files are ignored in `.gitignore`.
   - Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD.
4. **Access Control**
   - Review permissions for contributors and CI runners.

## Analytics Integration Steps
1. **Usage Logging**
   - Extend `logs/api_requests.log` for usage metrics.
2. **Monitoring**
   - Integrate Prometheus or similar for resource monitoring.
3. **Reporting**
   - Automated reports for usage, errors, and performance.

## Next Actions
- Add security checks to CI/CD workflow.
- Document analytics endpoints and metrics.
- Review and update `.gitignore` for sensitive files.
