# Project Plan: LLaMA GPU Project

## Overview
This project plan outlines the architecture, modules, milestones, and future improvements for the LLaMA GPU project. The goal is to deliver a modular, maintainable, and production-ready system for LLaMA model deployment and management on GPU hardware.

## Architecture & Modules
- Modular backend (CPU, CUDA, ROCm)
- Plugin Manager (dynamic loading, validation, event hooks)
- Dashboard (Flask UI for management)
- Plugin Marketplace (UI and backend)
- Monitoring (Prometheus integration, plugin health)
- Config Manager (YAML/JSON config loading)
- Role Manager (user/role management)
- Utilities (logging, error handling, data preprocessing)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Documentation (API docs, module docs)

## Milestones
1. Backend implementation and testing
2. Plugin Manager core features
3. Dashboard and Marketplace UI
4. Monitoring and health checks
5. Config and role management
6. CI/CD and documentation
7. Advanced features: edge deployment, quantization, distributed inference
