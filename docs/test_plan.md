# Test Plan: LLaMA GPU Project

## Overview
This test plan covers unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing for all major components of the LLaMA GPU project.

## Test Strategy
- Automated tests for all code modules
- Continuous Integration (CI) enforcement
- Manual acceptance testing for API and CLI usability

## Test Coverage
### 1. Backend Modules
- [x] Unit tests for CPU, CUDA, ROCm backends
- [x] Mock hardware detection for consistent results
- [x] Integration tests for backend selection and fallback

### 2. LlamaGPU Interface
- [x] Integration tests for backend selection logic
- [x] Inference tests for all supported backends

### 3. Utilities & Scripts
- [x] Logging utility tests
- [x] Setup and monitoring script tests

### 4. Benchmarking
- [x] Benchmark script tests for timing and output
- [x] Validation on CPU and GPU hardware

### 5. Documentation
- [x] Docstring coverage tests for public methods
- [x] Example script and notebook existence tests

### 6. CI/CD
- [x] All tests run in GitHub Actions
- [x] Code style enforced via pre-commit hooks

## Manual Testing
- [ ] API endpoint acceptance tests
- [ ] CLI usability and error handling
- [ ] Model management and quantization workflows

## Future Improvements
- Expand edge case and error handling tests
- Add more advanced benchmarking and quantization validation
- Integrate test coverage reporting and dashboards
- Regularly update this plan as new features are added

## [2025-07-21] Test Plan Update
- Added tests for quantization utilities and backend integration
- Added tests for memory usage reporting
- All test results are now logged to logs/test_output.log for traceability
- Next: expand tests for advanced inference, async, and monitoring features

## [2025-07-21] Advanced Inference Optimizations Test Plan
- Add tests for streaming, batching, and async inference features
- Log all test outputs to logs/test_output.log for review
- Next: benchmark and validate performance, monitor resource usage

## [2025-07-21] Progress Update
- Test stubs added for fine-tuning, distributed inference, security, caching, monitoring, and edge optimization
- All test outputs are logged in logs/ for examination
- Next: expand test coverage for new features, add integration and performance tests

## Phase 1: Core Modules
- [x] Test backend and advanced modules

## Phase 2: Automation & Dashboard
- [x] Test cloud deployment script for all providers
- [x] Test dashboard endpoints and logging

## Phase 3: Extensibility
- [x] Test plugin manager: load, unload, error handling
- [x] Test plugin template: inheritance, run method
- [x] Test ONNX/TensorFlow model loading (mock if packages unavailable)

## Phase 4: Security & Benchmarking
- [x] Test authentication: valid/invalid login, role assignment
- [x] Test benchmarking utility: timing, logging, edge cases

## Phase 5: Dashboard Enhancements
- [x] Test dashboard plugin listing and benchmarking endpoint

## Phase 6: CI/CD & Testing
- [ ] CI/CD: multi-cloud, coverage, security scan tests
- [ ] Automated regression/integration tests
- [ ] Plugin marketplace integration tests

## Phase 7: Monitoring & Marketplace
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting integration tests
- [ ] Plugin marketplace: install/update/discovery tests

## Phase 8: API & Edge
- [ ] API documentation validation
- [ ] Edge deployment automation tests

## Phase 9: Feedback & Refinement
- [ ] User feedback tests (dashboard, API)
- [ ] Periodic refinement and regression tests
