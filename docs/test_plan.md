# Test Plan: LLaMA GPU Project

## Overview
This test plan covers unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing for all major components of the LLaMA GPU project.

## Test Strategy
- Automated tests for all code modules
- Continuous Integration (CI) enforcement
- Manual acceptance testing for API and CLI usability

## Test Coverage
### 1. Backend Modules
- [x] Unit tests for CPU, CUDA, ROCm backends
- [x] Mock hardware detection for consistent results
- [x] Integration tests for backend selection and fallback

### 2. LlamaGPU Interface
- [x] Integration tests for backend selection logic
- [x] Inference tests for all supported backends

### 3. Utilities & Scripts
- [x] Logging utility tests
- [x] Setup and monitoring script tests

### 4. Benchmarking
- [x] Benchmark script tests for timing and output
- [x] Validation on CPU and GPU hardware

### 5. Documentation
- [x] Docstring coverage tests for public methods
- [x] Example script and notebook existence tests

### 6. CI/CD
- [x] All tests run in GitHub Actions
- [x] Code style enforced via pre-commit hooks

## Manual Testing
- [ ] API endpoint acceptance tests
- [ ] CLI usability and error handling
- [ ] Model management and quantization workflows

## Future Improvements
- Expand edge case and error handling tests
- Add more advanced benchmarking and quantization validation
- Integrate test coverage reporting and dashboards
- Regularly update this plan as new features are added

## [2025-07-21] Test Plan Update
- Added tests for quantization utilities and backend integration
- Added tests for memory usage reporting
- All test results are now logged to logs/test_output.log for traceability
- Next: expand tests for advanced inference, async, and monitoring features

## [2025-07-21] Advanced Inference Optimizations Test Plan
- Add tests for streaming, batching, and async inference features
- Log all test outputs to logs/test_output.log for review
- Next: benchmark and validate performance, monitor resource usage

## Progress Update [2025-07-21]
- All tests are logged to logs/test_output.log
- Added tests for async API, monitoring, and benchmarking
- Suggestions for future tests: error handling, model management, API security, frontend/dashboard
- Next: expand test coverage for new phases and features
