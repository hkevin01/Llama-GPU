# LLaMA GPU Test Plan

## Latest Test Results (2025-07-21)
- [ ] Test run in progress (see logs/test_output_2025-07-21_backend_expanded_final.log for partial results)
- [x] Backend refactor and expanded backend tests in progress
- Main areas for new/remaining tests:
  - [ ] batch_infer and stream_infer for all backends (with mocks) [in progress]
  - [ ] Error handling (invalid model path, inference errors) [planned]
  - [ ] Edge cases (empty input, large batch, etc.) [planned]
  - [ ] Node.js/JS/TS lint/format/test coverage [future]

## Maintenance
- [x] Test plan is actively maintained and up to date
