   - Enhance error handling and reporting
   - Improve documentation and examples

3. **Feature Development**
   - Add support for latest Llama model versions
   - Implement efficient model loading
   - Enhance chat interface capabilities

## Long-term Goals

1. **Architecture**
   - Develop pluggable backend system
   - Support distributed computing
   - Implement model parallelism

2. **Ecosystem**
   - Build comprehensive tooling
   - Create plugin system
