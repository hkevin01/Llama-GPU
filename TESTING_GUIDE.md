# 🧪 Quick Test Guide - Llama-GPU Interface

## Step-by-Step Testing Instructions

### **Prerequisites Check** ✅
Your system already has:
- ✅ Node.js v22.17.1 (Compatible)
- ✅ npm 10.9.2 (Working)
- ✅ All dependencies installed (1,513 packages)
- ✅ All components created and error-free

---

## **Step 1: Start the Application** 🚀

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
cd /home/kevin/Projects/Llama-GPU
./start-gui.sh
```

This will:
- Navigate to the GUI directory
- Start the React development server
- Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
- Display a loading screen, then the main dashboard

---

## **Step 2: Basic Navigation Test** 🗺️

**Test the main interface:**
1. **Sidebar Navigation**: Click each menu item:
   - 📊 Dashboard (overview page)
   - 🤖 Models (model management)
   - 💬 Inference (text generation)
   - 🖥️ Multi-GPU (GPU configuration)
   - ⚡ Quantization (model compression)
   - 📈 Performance (monitoring)
   - 🌐 API Server (server control)
   - ⚙️ Settings (preferences)

2. **Theme Toggle**: Click the theme icon in the header to switch between dark/light mode

3. **Responsive Design**: Resize your browser window to see mobile adaptation

---

## **Step 3: Feature Testing** 🔧

### **Dashboard Page** 📊
**What to look for:**
- ✅ 4 status cards showing system metrics
- ✅ Real-time performance charts updating every few seconds
- ✅ GPU utilization displays with animated progress bars
- ✅ Activity feed with recent system events
- ✅ System status indicators (green/yellow/red)

### **Model Manager** 🤖
**What to test:**
- ✅ Model dropdown with 6 available models (Llama-2-7B, etc.)
- ✅ Backend selection buttons (CUDA, CPU, ROCm, Metal)
- ✅ Click "Load Model" - should show loading spinner then success
- ✅ Model information display with specifications
- ✅ System requirements section

### **Inference Center** 💬
**What to test:**
- ✅ Type text in the prompt area
- ✅ Adjust parameters with sliders (temperature, max tokens)
- ✅ Click "Generate" - should show streaming text simulation
- ✅ Toggle "Streaming Mode" on/off
- ✅ Add items to batch processing queue
- ✅ View generation history

### **Multi-GPU Configuration** 🖥️
**What to test:**
- ✅ GPU detection showing 2 mock GPUs
- ✅ Change parallelism strategy (Data, Model, Pipeline)
- ✅ Adjust load balancing (Round Robin, Least Loaded)
- ✅ Move memory allocation sliders
- ✅ Watch GPU utilization charts update

### **Performance Monitor** 📈
**What to test:**
- ✅ Real-time charts updating automatically
- ✅ Performance KPIs changing (tokens/sec, latency)
- ✅ GPU memory usage graphs
- ✅ System resource monitoring
- ✅ Click export buttons

### **Settings & API Control** ⚙️
**What to test:**
- ✅ Change notification preferences
- ✅ Adjust refresh intervals (affects chart updates)
- ✅ API Server page - start/stop server controls
- ✅ Configuration export/import buttons
- ✅ Theme and display settings

---

## **Step 4: Real-time Features Test** ⚡

**Watch for these automatic updates:**
- 🔄 Performance charts refreshing every 2 seconds
- 🔄 GPU utilization percentages changing
- 🔄 Status indicators updating
- 🔄 Activity feed adding new events
- 🔄 Memory usage graphs animating

---

## **Step 5: Visual Quality Check** 🎨

**Look for:**
- ✅ **Professional appearance** - Clean, modern design
- ✅ **Consistent styling** - Material-UI components throughout
- ✅ **Smooth animations** - Transitions and hover effects
- ✅ **Readable text** - Good contrast in both themes
- ✅ **Responsive layout** - Adapts to window size
- ✅ **No visual glitches** - Components render properly

---

## **Step 6: Error Testing** 🛠️

**Try these to test error handling:**
- 🧪 Click buttons rapidly to test loading states
- 🧪 Switch between pages quickly
- 🧪 Toggle theme multiple times
- 🧪 Resize window while charts are updating
- 🧪 Check browser console for any errors (F12)

---

## **Expected Results** ✅

**If everything is working correctly, you should see:**

1. **Immediate startup** - Application loads in 2-3 seconds
2. **Responsive interface** - All interactions feel smooth
3. **Live data simulation** - Charts and metrics updating
4. **Professional appearance** - Modern, polished design
5. **No console errors** - Clean JavaScript execution
6. **All features functional** - Every button and control works

---

## **What If There Are Issues?** 🔧

**Common solutions:**

1. **Port already in use**:
   - Stop other processes using port 3000
   - Or the app will automatically use port 3001

2. **Slow loading**:
   - First load takes longer due to compilation
   - Subsequent loads should be faster

3. **Charts not updating**:
   - Check refresh interval in Settings
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled

4. **Styling issues**:
   - Clear browser cache
   - Ensure all CSS loaded properly

---

## **Success Criteria** 🎯

**Your test is successful if:**
- ✅ Application starts without errors
- ✅ All pages are accessible and load quickly
- ✅ Interactive elements respond immediately
- ✅ Charts show animated, updating data
- ✅ Theme switching works instantly
- ✅ No JavaScript errors in browser console
- ✅ Professional, modern appearance throughout

---

## **Next Steps After Testing** 🚀

Once testing confirms everything works:

1. **Integrate with Backend**: Connect to your Python API endpoints
2. **Customize Features**: Modify components for specific needs
3. **Deploy**: Build for production or package as desktop app
4. **Extend**: Add new features or modify existing ones

---

**Happy Testing! 🎉**

Your Llama-GPU Interface is ready for immediate use and should provide a professional, modern experience for GPU-accelerated model inference management.
